Impact  of  a  pilot  laboratory
safety  team  workshop

Recurring  academic  laboratory  accidents  and  a  lack  of  consensus  about  the  best  approach  to  chemical  safety
culture  education  has  led  to  the  development  of  laboratory  safety  team  (LST)  programs  at  many  research
institutions  in  the  United  States.  LSTs  are  collaborative  groups  that  seek  to  improve  the  safety  culture  within
a  department  or  multiple  departments.  They  usually  consist  of  a  partnership  between  departmental  faculty,
staff,  and  students  and  have  the  goal  of  providing  concrete  opportunities  for  all  of  these  stakeholders  to
continuously  improve  safety  practices  within  their  department.  These  programs  also  offer  a  supplementary
form  of  safety  education  that  is  designed  to  ﬁt  the  speciﬁc  culture  and  needs  of  each  institution.  As  these
programs  have  developed  in  a  variety  of  institutions,  best  practices  for  forming  and  maintaining  LSTs  have
begun  to  emerge.  In  order  to  better  understand  these  best  practices,  we  developed  a  pilot  workshop  for  the
255th  National  American  Chemical  Society  Meeting  audience  to  provide  attendees  with  the  knowledge  and
resources  to  go  back  to  their  home  institutions  and  establish  LSTs  or  similar  programs.  To  understand  the
effectiveness  of  this  pilot  workshop,  we  conducted  a  small  survey  of  the  attendees  at  the  ﬁrst  presentation.
Questionnaires  before  and  after  the  workshop  show  that  the  workshop  was  well  received  overall.  Parti-
cipants  became  more  conﬁdent  in  their  ability  to  teach  others  about  safety  and  gained  an  improved
understanding  of  safety  topics  and  resources.  There  is  also  evidence  that  the  workshop  changed  participants
perception  on  their  own  career  values  and  their  institution’s  values  on  laboratory  safety.  These  results  are
promising  and  give  us  hope  that  programs  such  as  this  can  be  a  useful  platform  for  safety  education.

INTRODUCTION

Recurring  laboratory  accidents  over  the
years  have  drawn  attention  to  the  ques-
tion  of  whether  adequate  training  in
laboratory  safety  is  provided  to  students
and  researchers  at  academic  institu-
tions.1,2 One  outcome  of  this  longstand-
ing  debate  is  the  suggestion  that  labora-
tory  safety  can  potentially  be  integrated
in  a  chemist’s  higher  education  in  vari-
ety  of  ways.  Examples  of  potential
approaches  include:  inclusion  through-
out  the  classroom  and  laboratory  cur-

introduced  as  a  seminar  topic,  by  pro-
grams  within  each  research  group,  or  a
variety  of  less  traditional  methods.3–9 A
particular  challenge  identiﬁed  in  this
debate  is  that  safety  education  involves
development  of  both  technical  and  cul-
tural 
skills.  Traditionally,  chemical
safety  education  has  focused  on  the
development  of  technical  skills.  How-
ever,  the  required  technical  skills  vary
widely  depending  on  the  chemistries
that  are  being  studied.  This  variety  chal-
lenges  the  development  of  a  consistent
safety  culture  within  academic  depart-
ments  and  leads  to  a  lack  of  consensus
about  appropriate  safety  practices  and
education requirements. Thus,  the  ques-
tion  is  raised:  what  can  be  standardized
in  safety  education,  given  the  distinct
needs  and  culture  of  each  institution?10
laboratory  safety
teams  (LSTs)  have  emerged  across
the  United  States  as  a  potentially  effec-
tive  way  for  improving  safety  culture,
particularly  in  institutions  with  large
cohorts  of 
in
research.11,12 These  teams  offer  a  sup-
plementary  approach  to  safety  educa-
tion  that  is  designed  to  ﬁt  the  speciﬁc
culture  and  needs  of  each  institution.

In 

LSTs  often  take  the  form  of  a  collabo-
rative  group  of  students,  faculty,  and
safety  professionals  that  meet  on  a  reg-
ular  basis  to  improve  the  safety  culture
in  a  given  department  or  multiple
departments.  However,  the  organiza-
tional  structure  and  objectives  of  the
team  can  vary  widely  depending  on  the
institution’s  organizational  structure,
needs,  and  resources.

resources 

Typical  team  features  can  include:
appointment  of  safety  representative
(s)  from  research  groups  in  the  depart-
ment,  campaigns  to  raise  awareness  of
safety  concerns  throughout  the  depart-
ment  (e.g.,  safety  moments  and  hall-
way  posters),  peer 
laboratory  walk-
throughs,  providing 
for
students  to  practice  research  safely
(e.g.,  pre-arranged  safety  kits  and  peer
consultation), 
safety
trainings,  and  an  open  conversation
about  safety  in  the  research  labs.  It  is
important  to  note  that  LSTs  do  not
take  responsibility  for  enforcement  of
regulatory  compliance 
these
teams  should  instead  focus  on  creation
of  a  culture  where  safety  is  seen  as
fundamental  value  to  every  researcher
and  is  included  throughout  the  scien-
tiﬁc  method.13–15

After  ensuring  all  participants  have
this  solid  foundation,  they  were  intro-
duced  to  the  idea  of  LSTs  and  given  the
opportunity  to  discuss  how  these  safety
teams  might  work  at  their  own  institu-
tions.  All  activities  took  place  in  small
round  table  groups  for  20–40  min  each
with  the  assistance  of  two  moderators.

After  each 
topic,  participants  were
given  the  opportunity  to  ask  questions
and  reﬂect  with  the  group  as  a  whole.

Topic  1:  Safety  Education
A  few  examples  of  laboratory  accidents
were  used  to  open  the  workshop  and
emphasize  the  importance  of  labora-
tory  safety  in  academic  institutions  and
how  it  compares  to  industrial  stan-

when  performing  risk  assessments  and

Topic  2:  Academic  Safety  Culture
Academic  safety  culture  is  deﬁned  as
an 
values,
assumptions,  and  beliefs  speciﬁc  to
workplace  safety.  Or,  more  simply,  it
is  deﬁned  as  the  importance  of  safety
within 
to
other  priorities.14 After  a  discussion
of  the  meaning  of  safety  culture,  each
participant  was  assigned  to  reﬂect  on
their  own  institution’s  current  labora-
tory  safety  environment.  Participants
then  shared  their  opinions  on  what
an  ideal  safety  culture  should  be,  what
changes  could  be  made  in  their  current
institution,  and  the  limitations  of  their
current 
institution.  Emphasis  was
placed  on  relevant  occupational  safety
practices  and  strategies  for  organiza-
tional  change.

structure  of  academic  institutions.  Par-
ticipants  worked  together  to  deﬁne  the
responsibilities  and  limitations  of  six
groups  of  people  relating  to  laboratory
safety:  (1)  researchers  and  students,  (2)
environmental  health  and  safety  pro-
fessionals,  (3)  principal  investigators,
(4)  department  chairs,  (5)  vice  presi-
dents  of  research  and  deans,  and  (6)
presidents,  chancellors,  or  provosts.14
For  example,  researchers  have  the  abil-
ity  to  identify  day-to-day  safety  pro-
blems  within  the  laboratory  but  have
limited  control  over  funding  for  safer
laboratory  equipment.

Topic  4:  Laboratory  Safety  Teams
The 
the  workshop
focused  on  developing  individualized
plans  for  the  creation  or  improvement
of  LSTs.  Students  discussed  the  history
of  LSTs,  what  is  currently  practiced  at
their 
institutions,  shared  successful
programs  from  other  institutions,  and
formulated  plans  for  their  own  safety
team.  For  example,  what  leadership
structure  should  your 
team  have?
Who  is  part  of  the  team  leadership?
What  resources  will  your  team  offer
students  in  the  department?  How  will
you  incentivize  good  practices?  Con-
sideration  was  also  given 
to  cases
where  other  types  of  safety  programs
are  more  appropriate  than  LSTs.

Survey  Questions
To  assess  the  value  of  the  workshop  to
the  attendees,  two  surveys  were  given
(one  before  and  one  after  the  work-
shop).  This  study  was  created  to  give
an  understanding  of  participant  opi-
nions  before  and  after  attending  a
safety  workshop  at  the  Spring  2018
National  ACS  Meeting 
in  New
Orleans,  LA.  The  analyzed  surveys
were 
reviewed  and  approved  by
UIUC’s  Institutional  Review  Board  as
appropriate  for  use  with  human  sub-
jects.  There  were  22  participants  from
15  different  institutions  that  attended
the  workshop.  Participation  was  open
to  students,  faculty,  staff,  and  safety
professionals.  For  the  purpose  of  this
analysis,  only  the  student  participants
(N  =  15)  were  included  in  this  study.
All  student  participants  were  actively
involved 
in  academic  research.  We
analyzed  52  questions  grouped  into
the 
categories:

OUTCOMES

Description  of  Participants
Because  students  self-select  to  partici-
pate  in  this  workshop,  initial  questions
were  used  to  give  insight  into  the  stud-
ied  population  (Figure  2).  It  should  be
noted 
that  participants  were  com-
prised  mostly  of  graduate  students,
with  a  few  postdocs  and  undergradu-
ates  interested  in  academic  careers.  In
addition,  participants  mostly  attended
Research  1  Institutions  (R1)  for  their
safety  training  with  some  participants
from  Research  2  Institutions  (R2)  and
Primarily  Undergraduate  Institutions
(PUI).25 Given  that  LSTs  originated

these
results  are  more  likely  from  a  disparity
in  accessibility  to  National  ACS  Meet-
ings.  Development  of  more  accessible
programs  in  the  future  (e.g.,  webinars
or  online  modules) 
is  necessary  to
reach  and  meet 
the  needs  of  all
institutions.

Within  this  population  of  students,
many  were  interested  in  starting  safety
teams  at  their  own  institutions.  Before
the  workshop,  93%  of  participants  did
not  believe  they  do  not  have  time  for
laboratory  safety  and  100%  of  partici-
pants  did  not  believe  that  they  should
not  be  responsible  for  the  safety  of
others  (Figure  3).  Additionally,  80%
of  participants  thought  they  had  good
safety  practices  in  the  lab  and  80%
thought  they  regularly 
incorporated
risk  management  into  the  design  of
their  own  experiments.  Despite  these
participants  having  a  largely  positive
safety  outlook  and  practices,  73%  still

wanted  more  training.  These  responses
suggest  that  the  participants  were  a
highly  motivated  group  of  students
and  that  their  current  educational  pro-
grams  did  not  include  adequate  safety
instruction  for  their  purposes.

Impact  of  Workshop  on  Participant
Conﬁdence
Survey  results  suggest  that  participants
gained  valuable  resources  to  take  back
to  their  own  institutions.  When  asked
what  part  of  the  workshop  was  most
beneﬁcial,  one  student  said  it  was  the
“role  of  administration  in  safety  and
beneﬁts  of  establishing  university  wide
safety  programs.”  Other  students  said,
“I  was  unaware  of  the  different  groups
on  each  campus  that  promote  safety”
and  “I  did  not  realize  the  admin  staff  of
any  institution  would  ever  have  a  role  to
play  in  laboratory  safety.”  Based  on  t-
test  results  and  the  Cohen’s  d  values,
we  can  say  that  our  workshop  had  a

to  think  about  chemical  safety,”  (b)  “I’m  not  responsible  for  the  safety  of  others,”  (c)
“I  have  good  safety  practices  in  the  lab,”  (d)  “I  regularly  incorporate  risk  manage-
ment  into  the  design  of  my  own  experiments,”  and  (e)  “I  need  more  training  in

pants  on  where  to  seek  out  more  infor-
mation (Figure 4a), a large effect on their
individual  conﬁdence  as  safety  leaders
(Figure  4b),  and  a 
large  effect  on
participants’  knowledge  of  what  a
chemical 
safety  professional  does
(Figure  4c).  The  increase  in  students’
knowledge  on  where  to  go  to  learn
about  chemical  safety  (Figure  4a)  was
less  than  expected.  However,  this  may
simply  be  because  participants  were
already  relatively  knowledgeable  about
chemical  safety  resources.  It  is  interest-
ing  to  note  that  their  opinion  of  their
needed 
training
(Figure  4d)  did  not  signiﬁcantly  change.
This  suggests  that  even  with  additional
training,  these  participants  still  wanted
to  learn  more  about  chemical  safety  and
continue  to  improve  their  laboratory
safety  culture.  Additionally,  their  com-
fort  in  asking  their  labmates  to  improve

helped  participants  gain  conﬁdence  in
their  personal  chemical  safety  knowl-
edge  and  leadership  ability,  many  were
still  not  comfortable  approaching  peo-
ple  above  their  institutional  hierarchy.
It  is  possible  that  the  presence  of  an
LST  at  their  institution  will  help  bridge
this  gap  because  it  will  create  a  sup-

because  even  the  most  motivated  stu-
dents  can  be  discouraged  by  not  being
able  to  enact  change.  For  example,  if  the
participants  feel  that  their  contributions

Career  Value  of  Laboratory  Safety
Due  to  the  aforementioned  growing

LST  development  from  industries,  we
hoped  that  topics  1  (safety  education)
and  4  (history  and  examples  of  LSTs)
of  this  workshop  would  emphasize  the
importance  of  safety  as  a  core  value
when  entering  the  workforce.  Several
questions  were  asked  after  the  work-
shop  to  understand  participant  opi-
nions  regarding 
importance  of
chemical  safety  for  their  career  (Fig-

value  of  understanding  lab  safety,  both
for  their  personal  career  (100%)  and
for  their  resumes  (100%).  We  see  this

career.”

institutions  because  understanding
why  laboratory  safety  is  important  will
help  them  teach  others.  Additionally,
while  this  was  not  the  purpose  of  the
workshop,  we  also  asked  about  partic-
ipant  interest  in  chemical  safety  as  a
career.  Most  did  not  see  it  as  a  viable
career  path,  with  33%  negative
response  and  30%  neutral  response.
However,  47%  of  participants  positive
response.  It  is  interesting  to  show  that
so  many  of  these  students  have  an
open  mind  for  safety  as  a  career  option
and  suggests  an  untapped  market  for
future  safety  professionals.

Overall  Workshop  Success
In  planning  for  future  workshops,  we
asked  several  questions  relating  to

found
responses  that  were  promising  with
regards  to  the  longevity  of  this  pro-
gram.  Participants  would  recommend
this  workshop  to  others  (93%  posi-
tive  response)  and  thought  the  topics
were  relevant  and  activities  in  each
topic  were  useful  (100%).  Addition-
ally,  participants

in  their  career  (87%).
One  student  summarized  their  expe-
rience  as  “I  really  enjoyed  talking
with  my 
issues
and  how  they  handled  them.  I  just
want  to  see  workshops  like  this  more
often.”  One  area 
that  could  be
improved  is  that  only  64%  of  partici-
pants  thought  the  workshop  helped
them  develop  a  clear  plan  to  improve
or  develop  a  program  at  their  own
institution,  with  all  other  participants
having  a  neutral  response.  A  large
reason  for  this  is  possibly  the  over-
whelming  variety  of  structure  and
goals  of  current  LSTs.  Although  we
previously  mentioned  this  as  positive
attribute  of  LSTs  because  it  will  help
to  ﬁll  gaps  in  institutional  shortcom-
ings  relating  to  laboratory  safety,  it
could  make  starting  a  new  program  a
daunting  task.  This  problem  could  be
circumvented  in  the  future  by  devel-
oping  more  interactive  resources  to
help  new  student 
leaders  navigate
these  options  and  chose  LST  features
that  are  most  useful  for  their  own
institution  (e.g.,  online  modules  or
decision-making  questionnaires).

(d)  “This  workshop  helped  me  develop  a  clear  plan  to  improve  or  develop  a  program
at  my  own  institution.”

Limitations
While  these  results  are  quite  promis-
ing,  there  are  a  few  limitations  to  con-
sider.  One 
is  that  our  sample  size
(N  =  15)  makes  it  hard  to  make  large
claims.  Additionally,  our  population  is
self-selected  to  attend  the  workshop,
meaning  they  already  have  a  high  level
of  interest  in  the  topic.  Results  may
change  if  this  workshop  was  a  manda-
tory  event  at  another  venue.  Along  the
same 
line,  populations  will  change
every  time  a  workshop  is  offered  and
discrepancies 
subsequent
workshops  are  possible.  These  topics
are

workshop  analyses  or  when  applied
to  studies  on  other  programs.

CONCLUSIONS

to 

We  described  the  reasons  for  and  con-
tent  of  a  pilot  workshop  aimed  to
develop  future  leaders  of  laboratory
safety  teams.  Outcomes  of  this  work-
shop  were  investigated  through  a  study
via  surveys  given  before  and  after  the
workshop.  This  workshop  was  well
received  overall;  participants 
found
the  workshop  useful  and  would  recom-
mend  it  to  others.  Results  suggest  that
participants  became  more  conﬁdent  in
their  ability 
teach  others  about
safety  and  gained  an  improved  under-
standing  of  safety  topics  and  resources.
There  is  also  evidence  that  the  work-
shop  changed  the  participant’s  percep-
tion  of  their  own  career  values  and
their  institution’s  values  on  laboratory
safety.  These  results  are  promising  and
give  us  reason  to  expect  that  programs
such  as  this  can  be  a  useful  platform  for
safety  education  and  leadership  devel-
opment.  Moving  forward,  it  will  be
critical  to  encourage  open  communi-
cation  and  resource-sharing  between
leaders26,27 because  program
LST 
complexity  will  be  a  major  hurdle  for
new  LSTs.  In  addition, 
interactive
resources  for  safety  leaders  would  be
useful  for  the  design  of  new  programs.
