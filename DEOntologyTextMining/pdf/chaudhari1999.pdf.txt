Abstract

Hydrogenation of diethyl maleate using copper chromite catalyst was investigated in a "xed-bed reactor with the aim of kinetic
modelling and reactor performance studies. The e!ect of contact time (W/F), hydrogen pressure (1}5 MPa), and feed composition
on the global rate of hydrogenation and selectivity was studied. The main products formed were c-butyrolactone (GBL), tetrahy-
drofuran (THF), diethyl succinate (DES) and 1,4 butanediol (BDO), but the selectivity of THF was higher in comparison to GBL and
(600 lm were found to be in kinetic regime and both intraparticle and external mass transfer
BDO in most cases. The results at dP
’3 mm, intraparticle di!usion e!ects were found to be important. Based on the integral reactor
resistances were negligible, but for dP
data, the rate equations have been proposed for various reaction steps assuming single site L}H-type mechanism. Hydrogenation
experiments were also carried out on a pilot plant scale (1.5 kg catalyst capacity) and the reactor performance was found to agree
reasonably well with the predictions of a theoretical model. ( 1999 Elsevier Science Ltd. All rights reserved.

1. Introduction

Hydrogenation of diethyl maleate is an industrially
important reaction for the manufacture of c-butyrolac-
tone (GBL), 1,4-butanediol (BDO) and tetrahydrofuran
(THF). THF is used mainly for the manufacture of span-
dex "bres, polyurethane elastomers and as a solvent for
various copolymers. GBL and its derivatives are used as
solvents and intermediates for pharmaceuticals (Mit-
subishi, 1988), while 1,4 butanediol is a raw material for
modern
polybutylene
terephthalate (PBT)
(Brownstein and List, 1977). A
route based on the catalytic hydrogenation of maleic
anhydride (MAN) or its esters (Harris and Tuck, 1990), is
gaining more importance because (i) it eliminates the use
of hazardous raw materials like acetylene, used in the
conventional Reppe process (Brownstein, 1991) (ii) THF
can be directly produced without involving a separate

step of dehydration of BDO (iii) maleic anhydride is now
readily available as a cheaper feedstock, based on
C4 oxidation technologies. The alternatives for conver-
sion of MAN to THF/GBL/BDO include hydrogenation
of anhydrous MAN (Kanetaka et al., 1970; Hermann and
Emig, 1997), aqueous maleic acid solution (Schwartz,
1995) or dialkyl maleate (Bradley et al., 1982). Among
these, the process via vapour-phase hydrogenation of
diethyl or dimethyl maleate using copper-based catalysts
provides a simpler, low-pressure process at relatively
milder operating conditions.

The hydrogenation of dialkyl maleate is known to
occur in the presence of copper-chromite (Blanshtein
et al., 1973), Cu}Al-borate (Kouba and Zletz, 1986),
Cu/TiO2 (Irick et al., 1990), and Ru}Sn boride catalysts
(Deshpande et al., 1990). Liquid-phase hydrogenation
requires very severe operating conditions (553}573 K and
20}30 MPa pressure), but, the vapour-phase reaction is
conveniently carried out at milder conditions such as
464}523 K and 3}5 Mpa pressure (Bradley et al., 1982).
Castiglioni et al. (1993) have observed that a partial
substitution of magnesium ions for the copper ions in-
creases the productivity of GBL in hydrogenation of

maleic anhydride, inhibiting further hydrogenation reac-
tions. Turek et al. (1994) investigated hydrogenation of
dimethyl succinate on supported copper, copper}zinc
and copper chromite catalysts and discussed the product
distribution and reaction kinetics.

The previous work on this subject has been mostly
patented and only limited information is published on
the nature, composition and characterisation of various
catalysts. Particularly, there is no signi"cant report on
the intrinsic kinetics of various reactions involved
in vapour-phase hydrogenation of diethyl maleate based
on which a commercial plant is operating (Brownstein,
1991). The aim of this work was to undertake a detailed
study on kinetic modelling in a "xed-bed catalytic reac-
tor using a copper chromite catalyst. The e!ect of liquid
#ow rate, temperature and hydrogen pressure on the
reactor performance was investigated and based on these
data Langmuir}Hinshelwood-type rate equations have
been proposed. Further, the signi"cance of external and
intra particle di!usion e!ects have been analysed and
a theoretical model for a "xed-bed reactor proposed.
Experimental results were also obtained on a pilot plant
scale and the results have been compared with theoretical
predictions.

2. Experimental

2.1. Catalyst and materials

The copper chromite catalyst was prepared by a pro-
cedure described elsewhere (Lazier and Arnold, 1955).
This involved co-precipitation of copper chromite from
the aqueous solution of copper nitrate using ammonium
chromate followed by "ltration, drying, calcination (at
553 K) and pelletisation. The smaller size catalyst par-
ticles were obtained by crushing the pellets and then
sieving through appropriate mesh size. The prepared
catalyst had the following speci"cations: copper (mol%):
31.5; chromium (mol%): 18.5; aluminium (mol%): 30;
zinc (mol%): 20; surface area (m2/kg): 3.88]104; solid-
phase density (kg/m3): 4.2]103; porosity: 0.53.
Hydrogen gas with ’99.98% purity was supplied by
M/s Indian Oxygen Ltd., Mumbai, and was used directly
from the cylinder. Diethyl maleate (DEM) ’99.5% pu-
rity was prepared by esteri"cation of maleic anhydride
followed by fractional distillation.

2.2. Apparatus

The laboratory scale hydrogenation experiments were
carried out in a high-pressure catalyst unit supplied by
M/s Geomechanique, France. The detailed description of
the set-up used is given by Jaganathan et al. (1998). The
reactor consisted of a single SS tube with a diameter
1.9]10~2 m having a maximum catalyst loading capa-

city of 3]10~3 kg. Experiments were also carried out in
a pilot plant reactor which consisted of a single tube SS
reactor of 2.5]10~2 m diameter and 3 m length, in which
1.5 kg of the catalyst was loaded. The maximum operat-
ing pressure and temperature of the reactor were 4.0 MPa
and 533 K, respectively. The liquid and gaseous feeds
were introduced into the reactor from the top, with
preheated liquid feed through a mixer. The reactor was
maintained at a desired temperature by circulating hot
oil through the jacket of the reactor. The products
coming out of the reactor were cooled and the liquid
product was collected in the knockout pot. The gases
containing H2 from reactor exit were further cooled with
chilled water (!53C) and recycled back to the reactor
through the compressor.

2.3. Procedure

In a typical hydrogenation experiment, a weighed
quantity (1]10~3 kg) of catalyst was charged in the
central portion of the reactor in order to avoid any
temperature gradients, while the top and bottom por-
tions were "lled with inert packing (carborundum). The
reactor was #ushed thoroughly with N2 and then with
H2 and the catalyst was activated at 473 K, under a con-
tinuous #ow of H2 (1]10~2 m3/h) at a pressure of
0.5 MPa, for 72 h. After the catalyst activation and attain-
ing the set reaction conditions, the liquid reactant (DEM)
feed was started. The liquid samples were collected peri-
odically from the gas}liquid separator and were analysed
by gas chromatography (HP 5840) using a 10% OV-17,
on chromosorb SS column of 2.5 m length.

3. Results and discussion

Hydrogenation experiments were carried out with the
aim of (a) kinetic modelling using Cu-chromite catalyst
and (b) performance of a "xed-bed catalytic reactor at
laboratory and pilot plant scales. For this purpose, the
e!ect of temperature, pressure and liquid #ow rate on
the conversion of diethyl maleate (DEM), diethyl succi-
nate (DES) and products formation was investigated in
a temperature range of 463}543 K. The range of condi-
tions studied was: H2 pressure, 1.98}8.0 Mpa and W/F,
0.16}0.5 h. In these experiments, the concentrations of
reactants and products in the exit of the reactor were
determined from which the conversion and selectivity
were evaluated.

3.1. Product distribution and selectivity

In the preliminary experiments, the catalyst activity
pro"le was studied over a prolonged time to ensure
constancy of the intrinsic catalytic activity for the experi-
mental duration. It was observed that for hydrogenation

of DEM at 503 K and 4 MPa H2 pressure, the initial
hydrogenation activity dropped over a period of 40 h
after which, it remained nearly constant for more than
300 h (see Fig. 1). Therefore, all the experiments for
product distribution, kinetic modelling and reactor per-
formance studies were carried out under steady-state
conditions (after 50 h of
initial start up). A typical
product distribution pattern for di!erent W/F is shown
in Figs. 2 and 3 for 503 and 523 K.

The main reaction products formed during hydrogen-
ation of DEM were diethyl succinate, c-butyrolactone,
tetrahydrofuran (THF), 1,4 butanediol and ethanol. GC
analysis of a gas sample leaving the reactor showed the
absence of any gaseous products (hydrocarbons, CO2).
The analysis of the liquid samples showed that beside the
above products, formation of n-butanol was negligible
((0.5%) in all the experiments. These results account for
more than 95% material balance for the products formed
in hydrogenation of DEM and represent the reaction
scheme shown in Fig. 4.

It was generally observed that diethyl maleate was
completely consumed for all the experiments and the step
of conversion of DEM to DES was faster than sub-
sequent hydrogenation to products like THF, GBL and
BDO. Therefore, the results are presented in terms of
overall rate of hydrogenation (which represents sum total
of formation of products DES, THF, GBL and BDO)
and selectivity. The results are presented in Figs. 5}7. It
was observed that the rate of hydrogenation increases
with increase in DEM #ow rate upto 1.5]10~2 kg/h,
beyond which it has only a marginal e!ect. The rate
increases linearly with H2 pressure at all temperatures.
The selectivity of THF was found to increase with a in-
crease in DES conversion, while the selectivities of GBL

and BDO were not strongly in#uenced with change in
DES conversion for 503 K and 4 MPa pressure of H2.

3.2. Kinetic modelling

In order to study the intrinsic kinetics of hydrogen-
ation of DEM, it was ensured that the results were
obtained under kinetically controlled conditions. The
rate of reaction obtained for the particle sizes between

For this purpose, the gas}solid mass transfer coe$cient,

literature (Satter"eld, 1970). The values of a were found
to be in the range of 0.01}0.03 for particles (600 lm
indicating the absence of external mass transfer resist-
ance for the conditions of the present work.

For the interpretation of the kinetics of a multistep
catalytic reaction as considered in this work, the conven-
tional approach of using rate data under di!erential
conditions is not adequate. This is mainly due to the
observation that at lower conversion levels of DEM, only
one of the several reaction steps is predominant and the
data would not represent the entire reaction scheme as
described in Fig. 4. Therefore, it is necessary to interpret
the integral reactor data obtained over a wide range of
conversions.

A mathematical model was developed for predicting
the performance of a "xed-bed reactor where the intrinsic
kinetic regime is controlling. As already discussed this
regime is applicable to the data obtained after 50 h of
start of the run for a 600 lm catalyst particle. The kinetic
parameters were estimated by "tting the reactor exit
concentration of DES and other reaction products using
di!erent sets of inlet reaction conditions. The kinetic
model proposed here is based on a single site Lan-
gmuir}Hinshelwood-type of mechanism assuming that:
(a) isothermal conditions prevail in the reactor; (b) hydro-

A comparison between the model predictions and the
experimental data at 503 and 523 K is shown in Figs.
2 and 3, which indicates a good agreement con"rming the
validity of the proposed kinetic model. The average error
between the predicted and observed concentration values
was $7% for all temperatures. From the temperature
dependence of the rate parameters, the values of activa-
tion energies were estimated as: 3.41]104, 5.27]104,
5.77]104, 5.77]104, 4.26]104, 4.64]104 and 5.1]
104 kJ/kmol for the reaction steps (1)}(7), respectively,
given in the reaction scheme (Fig. 4).

After determination of intrinsic kinetic parameters, the
experimental concentration (at reactor exit) vs. =/F data
"6 mm, were used to evaluate the catalyst e!ec-
at dp
(8)}(13). These
tiveness factor values by solving Eqs.
values are presented in Table 3. The e!ectiveness factor
values indicate that intraparticle di!usion limitation was
signi"cant only for DES, GBL but was negligible for
THF, BDO and BuOH.

c-Butyrolactone is a major intermediate (Fig. 4) in the
hydrogenation of diethyl maleate. Hence it was thought
appropriate to conduct some experiments with GBL as
a starting feed to study the product distribution and the
kinetics of
this individual hydrogenation step. The

hydrogenation of GBL was carried out in a temperature
range of 483}523 K and various reactor inlet conditions.
The major products obtained were THF (52% selectivity)
and BDO (44% selectivity), with GBL conversion of
40%. It was interesting to observe that with decrease in
conversion of GBL selectivity to BDO increased which
was similar to that observed in the case of DEM hydro-
genation. The major di!erence between DEM and GBL
as feed for hydrogenation was that in case of DEM
hydrogenation, THF was the major product (&90%
selectivity considering converted DEM and DES) while
BDO formation was much lower (around 3}5%). In
contrast, BDO and THF formation was almost compa-
rable in GBL hydrogenation. This indicates that THF
formation is mainly via GBL hydrogenation rather than
dehydration of BDO.

Similar to hydrogenation of DEM described above,
rate equations for the intrinsic kinetics of hydrogenation
of GBL would be given as

the "rst two reactions are absent for the hydrogenation of
pure GBL. The rate and adsorption equilibrium para-
meters in the above equations for independent GBL
hydrogenation kinetics were evaluated using the proced-
ures as described in the previous section. The values of
the rate and adsorption constants are given in Table 4.
A comparison between the model prediction and the
experimental data at 503 K, is shown in Fig. 8, which
showed a good agreement. The values of activation ener-
gies estimated from the Arrhenius plot were 5.81]104,
5.64]104, 7.69]104 and 8.15]104 kJ/kmol for the reac-
tion steps 3, 4, 6 and 7, respectively, given in the reaction
scheme (Fig. 4).

On comparison of the values of rate constants in
Tables 2 and 4, it was found that the values of k3 repres-
enting the GBL hydrogenation step in the overall DEM
hydrogenation is much higher than that of individual
GBL hydrogenation. This can be due to either GBL
inhibited kinetics or the competitive adsorption between
BDO and GBL on the catalyst sites. The possibility of
blocking the active sites by BDO is more probable than
THF because in case of DEM hydrogenation inspite of
very high THF selectivity (90% THF and 3}5% BDO)
the GBL hydrogenation rates were higher than those
observed for pure GBL feed. A similar type of competi-
tive adsorption was observed by Messori and Vaccari
(1994) in case of solvent and anhydride in the vapour-
phase hydrogenation of maleic anhydride/GBL solu-
tions.

4. Pilot plant studies

Hydrogenation of DEM was also investigated on
a pilot plant scale in which a single tube reactor with
diameter 2.5]10~2 m and 3 m in length was used with
a capacity of 1.5 kg catalyst (6 mm dia., pellets). The
procedure followed for the pilot plant experiments was
similar to that for a laboratory scale except that the
experiments were carried out with recycle of H2 gas.
The conditions at the reactor inlet were so chosen that
the total #ow rate of H2 including the recycle stream and

composition of DEM in H2 was in the same range as the
laboratory scale. The e!ect of contact time (=/F ) and
H2 pressure on reactant/product concentration in exit
was investigated. Table 5, shows a comparison of the
laboratory scale operation with that of the pilot plant
scale at same temperature and pressure conditions. The
material balance obtained was excellent (’93%) for all
the runs and also the conversion and selectivities were
comparable or even better in some cases. In order to test
the applicability of the kinetics and "xed-bed reactor
model for predicting the performance of pilot plant reac-
tor, the Eqs. (10)}(15) were solved as described earlier
with catalytic e!ectiveness factor (g
i) values evaluated

also carried out on a pilot plant scale and the experi-
mental results were found to agree reasonably well with
the theoretical predictions.

5. Conclusions

Kinetic modelling of hydrogenation of diethyl maleate
was studied using a copper chromite catalyst in a "xed-
bed reactor. The major products formed were tetrahyd-
rofuran, c-butyrolactone, diethyl succinate alongwith 1,4
butanediol. A "xed-bed reactor model was used to evalu-
ate the integral reactor performance in which concentra-
tion of reactants and products in exit of reactor were
observed for di!erent inlet concentrations of DEM feed
rate, H2 pressure and temperatures. The reaction was
