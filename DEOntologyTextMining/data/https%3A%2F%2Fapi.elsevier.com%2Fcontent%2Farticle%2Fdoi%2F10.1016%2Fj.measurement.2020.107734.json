Abstract Micro-Electro-Mechanical Systems (MEMS) are today widespread in many industrial and consumer applications. In the field of terrestrial transportation, cellular, wearable devices, robotics, drone, to cite a few, MEMS-based Inertial Measurement Units (IMUs) are widely employed for assuring several tasks as for the object tracking, self-driving vehicles, human motion and so on. Expected performance of such systems and also recent literature and technical standards miss considering both a context-awareness reliability analysis and metrological performance analyses of MEMS-based IMUs when operating in real scenarios characterized by the presence of significant temperature excursions, humidity, vibrations, mechanical shocks and so on. In particular, standard procedures to be applied for testing MEMS-based IMUs are not still available. Trying to fill these needs, this paper proposes both a suitable testbed and test plans for performance analysis of such kinds of devices under vibration conditions. The application to a real IMUs has confirmed that the proposed tests allow identifying the effects of mechanical stress on both the reliability and metrological performance of such devices. These results could be useful also for the international committees involved in the definition of technical standards to be adopted for testing these kinds of devices. Keywords Testing Reliability Accelerometer Gyroscope Metrological performance Automotive 1 Introduction The interest in prognostic, fault diagnosis and condition monitoring rapidly increase over the last years due to the fast development of Industry 4.0. Considering the great increase of automation and the high complexity of the industrial equipment, the diagnostics process has become fundamental in every manufacturing field representing an essential part of performance requirements [1\u20134]. The diagnostic is used to evaluate the current health state of the system under test predicting its remaining useful life based on features that capture the gradual degradation of its operational capabilities. The diagnostic procedure allows improving reliability, availability, maintainability and safety (RAMS) parameters of complex systems, ensuring that the equipment works successfully and reducing downtime due to unexpected failures [5,6]. Inertial Measurement Units (IMUs) represent an essential part of a diagnostic system in many different application fields, like navigation and transportation, automotive and self-driving vehicles, cellular phones, human motion, robotics, and many others contexts [7\u201313]. Based on the complexity, costs, size and weight requirements of the specific application, Inertial Measurement Units could integrate: \u2022 a triaxial accelerometer used to measure the linear acceleration; \u2022 a triaxial gyroscope used to measure the angular rate; \u2022 a triaxial magnetometer used to measure the static magnetic field; \u2022 a subset of the previous sensors. Micro-Electro-Mechanical Systems (MEMS) devices are dominating the market of IMUs application because are a practical low-cost and low power solution [14]. MEMS sensors are small, easily integrated into almost every systems and they have great performances in terms of accuracy, stability integration capability and cost-efficiency [15\u201319]. The expected performance of such systems is provided in the related datasheets by their manufacturers which, generally, consider simplified operating conditions that are not well representative of the actual way of such devices operating. Indeed, typical information that can be found in datasheets deals with selectable ranges for measuring linear acceleration, angle rate, and static magnetic field, as well as the related sensitivity (to each detected quantity) and the temperature operating range. Nevertheless, the dynamic metrological performance and how the actual operating conditions can affect the metrological performance and reliability of such systems is not adequately dealt with. Moreover, also recent literature misses considering both a context-awareness reliability analysis and metrological performance analyses of MEMS-based inertial measurement units when operating in real scenarios characterized by the presence of significant temperature excursions, humidity, vibrations, mechanical shocks and so on. As an example, in the automotive context, in navigation and industrial environments, IMUs are continuously interested in mechanical stresses as random vibrations, so it is expected that the effects of such vibrations could generally affect both the metrological performance, the reliability and the time to failure. In particular, the reliability of IMU systems for diagnostic application is a key factor as well as their accuracy and all their metrological characteristics. This statement represents a critical aspect during the design phase because diagnostic elements are usually considered failure-free by definition. This assumption means that diagnostic must provide a continuous and reliable flow of information, without loss of calibration, erratic data or hardware failures in order to assure the expected behavior and the correct operation of the monitored system. Currently, there are not international standards specifically designed for the environmental test of IMUs, as well as customized standards for MEMS devices are not available. Starting from preliminary experimental results shown in [20], this paper proposes a customized measurement setup in order to analyze the effects of vibrations on MEMS-based IMUs for the automotive applications. The initial phase of the work was focused on the development of two different vibration test profiles (namely sweep sine and random, respectively). A suitable vibration test plan to be used in automotive environment for MEMS-based IMUs is proposed. To this aim, the following standards have been analyzed and merged for defining the test plan: \u2022 IEC international standards on environmental testing; \u2022 International standards for the electronic circuit used on automotive testing; \u2022 Military standards for testing procedures; \u2022 International standards for vibration tests on the microelectronic industry; \u2022 International standards for electronic and telecommunication systems used on-road vehicles. The second step of the work was focused on the design of a special purpose testbed which includes shakers and the realization of a suitable Printed Circuit Board (PCB), that specifically thought for testing MEMS-IMUs. Indeed, during the design phase, it is critical to ensure that the experimental results will depend only on device under test (DUT) performance and will not be affected by any auxiliary device adopted in the test set-up, like the Micro Controller Unit (MCU), the user monitor, the data logger, etc. The experimental tests were carried out at the Analytical CETACE test laboratory located in Scandicci, Florence, (Italy) with the aim of guarantee has high accuracy, high stability of the acquired data, no drifts and no intrinsic failure of the prototype under test. 2 The proposed test plan The environmental conditions influence the reliability performances of the electronical components used on automotive applications causing fatigue and fracture on the devices [21\u201323]. This paper proposes an innovative approach for the environmental characterization of the MEMS Inertial Modules based on vibration tests. A preliminary functional failure analysis is required to understand every possible failure mechanism that could lead to faults and malfunctions of the whole inertial module, focusing on the mechanical physical domain. The typical failure mechanisms of MEMS sensors are included in Table.1 . The table also includes a list of one or more failure causes and one or more acceleration factors for each failure mechanism. The acceleration factors are important parameters useful to understand which environmental condition influences the component reliability [19,24\u201327]. Vibrations, and more generally all mechanical shocks, influence almost all the possible failure mechanisms of the MEMS sensors, as highlighted using bold and italic character in Table 1. Our approach proposes two vibration test profiles considering several severities characterized by two different aims strictly related to each other: \u2022 To characterize the IMU behavior under vibration trying to highlight any possible drift of the device or possible loss of calibration; \u2022 to investigate any possible early failure due to infant mortality and consequently decrease the failure rate of the IMU under test in first phase of its lifecycle. The vibration test profiles designed for this application are very useful to verify that the MEMS Inertial Module will function in and withstand the vibration exposures of a life cycle in automotive application. This kind of test may be used to identify accumulated stress effects and the resulting mechanical weakness and degradation in the specified performance. The proposed test set-up is based on two different test procedures: Sweep sine test in subsection a) and random test in subsection b). The paper proposes a standard procedure specifically tuned to reflect the operative condition of the MEMS inertial module taking into account the real environmental condition of the automotive field. The random profile gives the opportunity to test the behavior of the system at different frequencies simultaneously, while the sweep sine test allows to investigate multiple frequency with very small discretization steps. 2.1 Sweep sine vibration test This test set-up was specifically designed for the IMU under test taking into account the automotive field of application comparing the following international standards: \u2022 IEC 60068-2-6 (2009) [28] is the European standard that regulate the environmental testing (section sinusoidal vibration); \u2022 AEC-Q100-rev.H (2014) [21] contains a set of failure mechanism based stress tests and defines the minimum stress test driven qualification requirements and references test conditions for qualification of integrated circuits used on automotive applications; \u2022 JESD22-B103B.01 (2016) [29] is a global standard for the microelectronics industry that focuses on vibration at variable frequency. The devices shall be vibrated with simple harmonic motion corresponding to the test levels shown in Table 2 . Each test severity will include simple harmonic motion of continuously swept frequency with the indicated peak-peak displacement below the crossover frequency and indicated peak acceleration above the crossover frequency. The allowed tolerance levels are \u00b1 3 d B among all the acceleration trend. The following information are mandatory to perform the tests and are common to all the severities: \u2022 Minimum frequency: 20 Hz. \u2022 Maximum frequency: 2000 Hz. \u2022 Sweep manner: logarithmic. \u2022 Sweep rate: 1 decade/min. \u2022 Number of sweep repetition: 4. \u2022 Axes: X, Y and Z. Considering the previous information, a complete sweep of the test frequency range, from the minimum to maximum and return to the minimum frequency will be performed in 4 min. Therefore, the duration of the complete test is 16 min. Fig. 1 shows the proposed vibration profile for the service condition S1. The dotted red line stands for the cross-over frequency, it dived the frequency range in two different sections: the low-frequencies where the shaker controls the displacement peak-to-peak and the high-frequencies where the shaker controls the peak acceleration. 2.2 Random vibration test \u2022 This test set-up was developed comparing different random vibration profiles included in the many international standards: \u2022 IEC 60068-2-64 (2012) [30] is the European standard that regulates the environmental testing (section random vibration); \u2022 JESD22-B103B.01 (2016) [29] is a global standard for the microelectronics Industry that focus on vibration at variable frequency; \u2022 ISO 16750-3 [31] deals with the environmental testing of electrical and electronic equipment used on road vehicles; \u2022 MIL-STD-810G (2008) [32] is a milestone for environmental engineering considerations and laboratory tests; \u2022 ETSI EN 300 019-2-5 [33] covers the environmental tests for telecommunications equipment for ground vehicle installations. The devices shall be vibrated with Gaussian random vibration. Generally, the random vibration test severity is described using the acceleration spectral density (ASD), which represents \u201cthe mean-square value of that part of an acceleration signal passed by a narrow-band filter of a center frequency, per unit bandwidth, in the limit as the bandwidth approaches zero and the averaging time approaches infinity\u201d [30]. As reported in [20], the random profile developed for this application is shown in Fig. 2 , where both frequency and ASD are reported in logarithmic scale. The following model describes the test severity at low-frequency, between 5 H z and 20 H z . (1) ASD = 2 m 2 s 3 = 0.02 g 2 H z i f f \u2208 5 - 20 H z Once overpass 20 H z , ASD decreases as -3 dB/oct up to 500 Hz . Table.3 contains all the test parameters of the developed procedure [20]. The key parameter is the Root Mean Square Acceleration G RMS which represents the square root of the area under the ASD curve in the frequency domain. It is important to note that G RMS contains no spectral information, therefore it cannot be used as the only constraint to define the test severity. G RMS is useful in monitoring vibration tests since RMS can be monitored continuously. 3 The proposed testbed In order to implement the test plan, a suitable testbed has to be developed. It has to be designed for assuring three main goals: 1) To host the DUT and realize the vibration profiles previously defined; 2) allows testing the performance only of the DUT by avoiding the influence of any auxiliary device adopted in the test set-up; 3) the DUT has to be mounted in such a manner to simulate classical automotive application or expected vibration during packaged shipment. To these aims, the testbed includes suitable shakers and the realization of a suitable Printed Circuit Board (PCB) thought for testing MEMS-IMUs without including external devices. Moreover, during the vibration test the device has to be rigidly fastened on the vibration platform and the leads adequately secured to avoid excessive lead resonance. 3.1 The adopted shakers The experimental tests were fulfilled using two different shakers with different performances: \u2022 Sentek M2232A used for X and Y axes 22 kN. \u2022 LDS V730 DPA10K used for Z axis 9.8 kN. Table 4 illustrates the main characteristics of the shakers. It is very important to note that the severities of the test proposed in the previous paragraph are within the specification of both shakers. Both shakers are connected to the same controller Dactron laser LS2000, which is an 8-channels controller with the possibility to switch between the two different actuators. The test set-up includes two identical 3056B2 General Purpose Piezoelectric Accelerometers by Dytran Instruments Inc. used as input channels for the vibration controller [34]. Table 5 summarizes the main performances of these sensors as reported also in [20]. One accelerometer was located directly on the device under test, in such a way its output could be used as control input signal for the controller, while the other accelerometer was located on the shaker table. Using this configuration, it is possible to control the amplitude of the vibration produced by the shaker allowing to apply the vibration profile directly on the DUT with high level of accuracy. The fixing of the device to the shaker represents one of the most challenging steps of the vibration test, it must propagate the vibration equally to all the sections of the device under test without absorb it. Moreover, it must be safe and it must have the resonance mode out of the profile frequency range. 3.2 The realized PCB In order to avoid the influence due to any auxiliary device adopted in the test set-up, the PCB is equipped with only the following components: \u2022 the device under test (DUT) which is a multi-sensor MEMS device that integrates one triaxial accelerometer, one triaxial gyroscope and one triaxial magnetometer integrated on an Inertial Measurement Unit for motorcycle; \u2022 the connectors used for both power supply and data communication with an external Micro Controller Unit (MCU). The MCU used is an STM32F401RE held on a suitable development board made by STMicroelectronics (STM NUCLEO 64). The NUCLEO 64 board connects the DUT through an SPI, and it is responsible for the data acquisition and the initial setup of the DUT. The board is also responsible for sending through a UART interface the data over a PC for their collection with respect to [20] where a Raspberry had been used as a data-logger. This choice has been done in order to speed up the data analysis. More in detail, in order to improve the reliability of the entire test and to verify the general validity of the achieved results, the experimental setup adopted is composed of three identical and independent systems composed of a DUT and a Nucleo board (see Fig. 3 ). The DUT considered is typically used in several applications like indoor navigation, smart user interfaces, advanced gesture recognition, and automotive; it includes a 3D digital linear acceleration sensor, a 3D digital angular rate sensor, and a 3D digital magnetic sensor. About the metrological performances, the DUT has a linear acceleration full scale of \u00b12 g/\u00b14 g/\u00b18/\u00b116 g, a magnetic field full scale of \u00b14/\u00b18/\u00b112/\u00b116 gauss and an angular rate of \u00b1245/\u00b1500/\u00b12000 dps. In the experimental test considered, the DUT has been configured to have a scale of 16 g for the accelerometer, 2000dps for the gyroscope achieving a sensitivity of 0.732 mg/LSB, and 70 mdps/LSB while it has not been considered the magnetometer. The DUT also gives the possibility to be used with different Output Data Rate (ODR), which depends on the specific application. The DUT manufacturer provides an anti-aliasing filter, according to the ODR selected. As an example, this study has chosen an ODR of 119 Hz since it is typically adopted in several positioning algorithms [35], which presents a cut-off frequency for the anti-aliasing filter of 50 Hz. According to the ODR selected, in order to maintain a real-time operation and avoid data loss, the communication speed interfaces have been set respectively to work at 400 kHz for the SPI and at 11,500 bps for the UART port. It is worth noting that, given the length of the tests (the duration varies between 16 and 30 min), the FLASH memory (512 kB) available on a single board is not enough to contain all the data coming from a single DUT, therefore, the raw data are stored and processed off-line with an external software (developed in MATLAB). \u2022 Fig. 4 shows the experimental set-up implemented for the random and sweep sine tests on XY plane and Z axis, respectively. 4 Experimental results This section reports the experimental results achieved during both random and sweep sine vibration profiles. For both the vibration profiles, the proposed tests are designed for allowing two kinds of analyses: Type 1: To compare the general operating of each sensor (accelerometer and gyroscope) of the DUT before and after the application of the vibration profile, in order to verify the capability of the DUT sensors to keep the expected performance once the stimulus, due to applied operating conditions, stops. Type 2: To evaluate the DUT sensors operating under the application of the considered stimulus in order to quantify some performance index. 4.1 Random vibration test Fig. 5 reports the evolution of the Root Mean Square (RMS) values measured by the accelerometers and gyroscopes of DUT #1 on both axes (x and y), when the shaker has actuated the vibration only along the z-axis (according to the reference system of Fig. 4). From the analysis of Fig. 5, it is possible to identify three main zones of interest namely (i) S1 which corresponds to a \u201cquite zone\u201d in which no vibration is applied by the shaker, (ii) S2 which corresponds to the vibration applied according to the excitation random profiles described in the previous section, and (iii) S3 which corresponds to a second \u201cquite zone\u201d which is reached after the shaker is stopped for finishing the test. As for Type 1 analysis, Tables 6 and 7 summarize the achieved results for all DUTs and the three sensors axes by showing the means (\u00b5) and standard deviations (\u03c3) of RMS values observed in S1 and S3, for both accelerometer and gyroscope, respectively. From the values observed in Tables 6 and 7, the following main considerations can be drawn: - Focusing the attention on the results achieved for the accelerometer sensor of DUT #1 (see the first row of Table 6), they show, for each axis (x,y,z), the full compatibility (from a measurement point of view) of the results achieved in S1 and S3. This outcome means that the application of the considered vibration stimulus does not affect both the accelerometer general operating and the sensor calibration. As for DUT #2 and DUT #3, although the measured values of \u00b5 and \u03c3 are in some cases different from the case of DUT#1, the comparisons between the behaviors shown in S1 and S3 confirm the full compatibility of the related results for each axis also for DUT#2 and DUT#3. Focusing the attention on the results achieved for the gyroscope sensors (see Table 7), different values of \u00b5 were observed for S1 and S3 whatever be the axis and the DUT considered. However, the observed values of \u03c3 cover these differences, which means that once again, the application of the considered vibration stimulus does not affect both the gyroscope general operating and the sensor calibration. As for the Type 2 analysis, as expected, during the application of the vibration profile (see the interval delimited by S2 in Fig. 5) the observed RMS values increase coherently with the input stimulus provided by the shaker. Moreover, these results prove that, even if the vibration is actuated only on the z-axis, a kind of sensitivity is observed also on the axis not excited during this test (i.e. x and y axis in the case of Fig. 5). Similar behaviours have been observed for DUT #2 and DUT #3. Such a generally unwanted sensitivity we propose to be quantified through the following parameters: (2) RR i , j = 20 \u2219 log 10 RMS i , S 2 RMS j , S 2 (3) SR i , j = 20 \u2219 log 10 RMS i , S 2 RMS i , S 1 where, i denotes the not excited (accelerometer or gyroscope) axis, j denotes the excited accelerometer axis, RMSi,S2 and RMSj,S2 the RMS values estimated in S2 for the i and j axes, and RMSi,Z1 the RMS value estimated in S1 for the i axis. As a consequence, RRi,j describes the rejection ratio of the i axis when the excitation is applied on the j axis whereas, SRi,j provides the ratio between the spurious response of the DUT on the considered axis with respect to the expected value (i.e. the quite zone value). Of course, RRi,j should be as high as possible (\u221e in the ideal case) whereas SRi,j should be as low as possible (0 in the ideal case). Tables 8 and 9 report the value of RRi,j and SRi,j for all accelerometer sensors of the three DUTs. From the analysis of Table 8, some considerations can be drawn: \u2013 RRi,j falls in the range [25 dB\u201345 dB] whatever be the DUT and the considered couple of axes (i and j); \u2013 For each DUT, the worst performance (lowest values of rejection ratio) is observed for RRx,z and RRy,z as can be expected also by seeing Fig. 5; \u2013 DUT #1 and DUT #3 show the best rejection ratios in the case of RRz,x , whereas DUT #2 shows the best performance in the case of RRx,y . From the analysis of Table 9, the following considerations can be drawn: - SRi,j falls in the range [8 dB\u201340 dB] whatever be the DUT and the considered couple of axes (i and j). It means that the Spurious response ratios never approaches the zero value (ideal case). - The worst cases are observed for the excitation on the z-axis (i.e. SRx,z and SRy,z ), coherently also with the results shown in Table 8. As for the gyroscope sensors, the meaning of RRi,j decays because the shaker does not apply any angular velocity, so only the SRi,j is evaluated since it allows comparing the working of the gyroscope between S1 and S2 whatever be the accelerometer excitation axis. Table 10 reports the achieved results for each accelerometer excited axis. From the analysis of such results, the following considerations can be drawn: - SRi,j falls in the range [9 dB\u201337 dB] whatever be the DUT and the considered couple of axes (i and j). Therefore, also in this case the Spurious response ratios never approaches the zero value (ideal case). - Once again, the worst cases are observed for the excitation on the z-axis (i.e. SRx,z and SRy,z ), coherently also with the results shown in Tables 8 and 9. 4.2 Sweep sine vibration test As described in the previous section, these tests require to sweep in the frequency range 20 Hz\u20132 kHz by continuously applying a sinusoidal stimulus for all the duration of the test. As a consequence, also in this case, it is possible to identify three zones S1, S2, and S3, to analyze the effects of the tests on the DUTs, thus suggesting to consider the previously defined two kinds of analyses (i.e. Type 1 and Type 2). In addition, for each frequency sweep, three values of the actuated vibration magnitude, i.e. 2 g, 4 g and 8 g, respectively, were applied. As for Type 1 analysis, Tables 11 and 12 summarize the achieved results for all DUTs and the three sensors axes by showing the means (\u00b5) and standard deviations (\u03c3) of RMS values observed in S1 and S3, for both accelerometer and gyroscope, respectively in the case of the 8 g-stimulus magnitude. From the values observed in Tables 11 and 12, similar considerations previously reported for the Random Vibration Test can be drawn. In particular, by comparing the values observed for \u00b5 and \u03c3, in S1 and S3, the application of the Sweep sine Vibration Test does not affect, the general operating and the calibration, of both accelerometer and gyroscope sensors, whatever be the considered axis and the DUTs involved. As for the Type 2 analysis, also in this case, during the application of the vibration profile the observed RMS values increases coherently with the input stimulus provided by the shaker. Indeed, as an example, Fig. 6 reports the evolution of the Root Mean Square (RMS) values measured by the accelerometer of DUT #1 on y-axis, when the shaker has actuated a sinusoidal vibration at a frequency equal to 20 Hz and a stimulus-magnitude equal 2 g, along the y-axis. As it happened in the case of the random vibration test, also in the case of the sweep sine vibration test, a kind of sensitivity has been observed also on the axis not excited during the test and here not reported for a sake of brevity. Moreover, since the sweep sine vibration test involves a frequency sweep, the observed RMS values coming from the accelerometer and gyroscope sensors can be useful for analysing the frequency response of the systems. As an example, Fig. 7 reports the accelerometer sensor output of DUT #1, for the considered frequency sweeps actuated on the y-axis together with the corresponding applied profile stimulus. As you can see, the accelerometer sensor has a low-pass filter behaviour related to the presence of the anti-aliasing filter, automatically inserted by the DUT once selected the sampling rate. In particular, since a sampling rate equal to 100 Hz has been selected, the 3 dB cut-off frequency of the anti-aliasing filter is nominally placed at 50 Hz and after such a frequency the accelerometer output generally decreases. In a more detail, focusing the attention on the case of the 4 g-stimulus magnitude (see Fig. 8 ), we can verify the non-ideal response of the sensor which is characterized by the presence of resonance zones (see the blue circles) in which very high variations of the gain are observable and that could make not forecastable the system frequency response. Indeed, considering the transfer function shown in Fig. 9 , we observed that even for frequencies greater than the cut-off one (i.e. 50 Hz), the gain of the system reaches (or in some case overcomes) the one evaluated below the cut-off frequency, thus overcoming the expected gain (black dashed line) inside these zones. This behaviour appears around a multiple of the frequency 60 Hz and could be imputable to unwanted mechanical resonance. To quantify the maximum deviation between the expected gain and the real one the Gain Deviation (GDi ) on the i-th axis has been defined and analysed: (4) GD i = 20 \u2219 log 10 M G E G where, EG and MG are the expected gain and the maximum measured gain, respectively, inside the first frequency resonance zone, on the i-th axis with (i = x|y|z). Table 13 reports the values of GD for all considered DUTs, excitation axes, stimulus magnitude, and accelerometer sensors. As for the accelerometer sensors (see Table 13), the following considerations can be highlighted: - The value of GD falls in the range [2.0 dB, 4.0 dB]; - The stimulus magnitude does not significantly affects the value of GD whatever be the excited axis and the DUT. As for the gyroscope sensors, Fig. 10 reports the output observed for DUT#1 on the three axes when the 4 g-magnitude sweep sinetest has been applied. As you can see, there are unexpected angular rotations on all the three axes over the considered frequency sweep range, and once again, some resonance zones can be identified. To evaluate such an effect, the proposed figure of merit, namely Spurious Gain (hereinafter SGi ), is given by the ratio between the maximum RMS value evaluated over the whole frequency sweep range (i.e. S2) and RMS value evaluated over the quite zone (i.e. S1), for each axis, as defined in the following: (5) S G i = 20 \u2219 log 10 max f \u2208 [ f min , f max ] R M S S 2 R M S S 1 Table 14 reports the value observed for SGi for each DUT when the 4 g-stimulus magnitude sinusoidal vibration is applied. It proves how the gyroscope sensors are generally influenced by spurious gain on each sensor axis. In particular, the values of SGi fall in the range [3.0, 20.0 dB] for each DUT, which means that a significant sensitivity to stimulus applied on the accelerometer axes is still observable as it happened in the case of Random Vibration test. 5 Conclusions Starting from the analysis of the state of the art and technical standards in the field of MEMS and IMU testing and characterization, this paper has proposed a testbed and a test plan specifically designed for performance analysis in automotive context of MEMS-based IMU devices under vibration conditions. After the definition of the kind of tests to be adopted, the paper has proposed two type of analysis (Type 1 and Type 2) and several figures of merit for evaluating (i) the DUT performance before and after the application of the vibration profile and (ii) the DUT performance during the application of the considered vibration stimulus. The application of the proposal to real DUTs based on very popular IMU devices has highlighted how the proposed tests and figure of merits allow identifying undesired behaviors of both accelerometer and gyroscope sensors. In particular, with reference to the Type 1 Analysis, the achieved results have shown that the proposed vibration tests (both Random and Sinusoidal) do not affect the general operating and the calibration of both accelerometer and gyroscope sensors because, once the external stimuli have been stopped, the sensors recover its normal operating. As for the Type 2 Analysis, some significant effects have been highlighted during the application of the external stimulus (both Random and Sinusoidal). In particular, thanks to the definition and the analysis of suitable rejection coefficients (i.e. RRi,j and SRi,j ) it has been highlighted how both the accelerometer and gyroscope sensors exhibit a significant sensitivity also on the not excited axes. Moreover, as for the accelerometer sensors, the frequency sweeps have highlighted as even for frequencies greater than the nominal cut-off frequency, some resonance zones appear, in which the gain can significantly overcome the expected gain inside these zones. These aspects have been quantified through the definition of the quantities GDi and SGi . It is expected that the achieved results be particularly useful for both general users of MEMS-based IMUs and the international committees involved in the definition of technical standards to be adopted for testing these kinds of devices. Future developments will concern with the analysis of the effects of the observed behaviors on measurement algorithms based on the use of IMUs. Furthermore the analysis of IMUs performance under different climatic conditions will be investigated as well. CRediT authorship contribution statement D.

In the field of terrestrial transportation, cellular, wearable devices, robotics, drone, to cite a few, MEMS-based Inertial Measurement Units (IMUs) are widely employed for assuring several tasks as for the object tracking, self-driving vehicles, human motion and so on. Expected performance of such systems and also recent literature and technical standards miss considering both a context-awareness reliability analysis and metrological performance analyses of MEMS-based IMUs when operating in real scenarios characterized by the presence of significant temperature excursions, humidity, vibrations, mechanical shocks and so on. In particular, standard procedures to be applied for testing MEMS-based IMUs are not still available. Trying to fill these needs, this paper proposes both a suitable testbed and test plans for performance analysis of such kinds of devices under vibration conditions. The application to a real IMUs has confirmed that the proposed tests allow identifying the effects of mechanical stress on both the reliability and metrological performance of such devices. These results could be useful also for the international committees involved in the definition of technical standards to be adopted for testing these kinds of devices.", "openArchiveArticle": "false", "prism:coverDate": "2020-07-01", "openaccessUserLicense": null, "prism:aggregationType": "Journal", "prism:url": "https://api.elsevier.com/content/article/pii/S0263224120302724", "dc:creator": [{"@_fa": "true", "$": "Capriglione, D."}, {"@_fa": "true", "$": "Carrat\u00f9, M."}, {"@_fa": "true", "$": "Catelani, M."}, {"@_fa": "true", "$": "Ciani, L."}, {"@_fa": "true", "$": "Patrizi, G."}, {"@_fa": "true", "$": "Singuaroli, R."}, {"@_fa": "true", "$": "Pietrosanto, A."}, {"@_fa": "true", "$": "Sommella, P."}], "link": [{"@_fa": "true", "@rel": "self", "@href": "https://api.elsevier.com/content/article/pii/S0263224120302724"}, {"@_fa": "true", "@rel": "scidir", "@href": "https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0263224120302724"}], "dc:format": "application/json", "openaccessType": null, "pii": "S0263-2241(20)30272-4", "prism:volume": "158", "articleNumber": "107734", "prism:publisher": "Elsevier Ltd.", "dc:title": "Development of a test plan and a testbed for performance analysis of MEMS-based IMUs under vibration conditions", "prism:copyright": "\u00a9 2020 Elsevier Ltd.
