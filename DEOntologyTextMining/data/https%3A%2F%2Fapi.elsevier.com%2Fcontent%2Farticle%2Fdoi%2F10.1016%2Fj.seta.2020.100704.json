Abstract 3D axisymmetric CFD model is developed for a solar chimney power plant (SCPP) in Manzanares, Spain, and potential impacts of chimney height ( H ) on main performance parameters are comprehensively analysed. Mesh-independent solutions are achieved, and accuracy justification is done over the previous numerical and experimental attempts prior to parametric research. Discrete ordinate (DO) non-grey radiation model with solar ray tracing approach is adopted in the research. A very good accordance is achieved between the numerical findings and in-situ data. For five different H values, temperature, pressure and velocity distributions within the pilot plant are achieved as well as maximum air velocity, mass flow rate of air, temperature rise in collector, dynamic pressure difference at the turbine position, overall system efficiency and potential electrical power. It is found that maximum air velocity thus mass flow rate shows an exponential growth in H . On the contrary, temperature rise in collector notably reduces with the increasing H . Overall system efficiency is determined to be 0.67% when H = 500 m. Power output ( P ) linearly rises with H . The system is capable of generating 55 and 134 kW electrical power, for H = 200 and 500 m, respectively. Keywords Solar chimney power plant CFD model Chimney height Solar intensity Optimisation Introduction Solar energy is harnessed for various purposes today. The most common use of solar energy in practice appears in solar thermal and solar electricity applications. Solar thermal systems basically aim at capturing incoming solar radiation within a blackened absorber surface in which there is a direct or indirect contact between the absorber and the working fluid [1]. On the other hand, solar electricity refers to the direct conversion of photons into electrical power through the semiconductor devices like photovoltaic (PV) modules [2]. It is well-documented in literature that both thermal performance figures and PV cell parameters are dependent on environmental conditions [3]. In other words, climatic parameters and locational characteristics play a key role in the overall performance assessment of solar energy applications. On the contrary to this common fact, there is a clean energy technology called solar chimney which is capable of generating electricity continuously irrespective of change in environmental conditions owing to its unique structure [4]. Solar chimneys do not require fossil fuels for operation, hence they do not cause any greenhouse gas emissions as a completely eco-friendly renewable energy application. Working principle of a typical solar chimney can be basically explained by the functions of two main parts of the whole plant, which are collector and chimney. Collector is the part which enables the penetration of solar thermal radiation into the air medium between the collector and the ground. The incoming solar radiation is absorbed by the ground material at a rate of its absorptivity coefficient, and as a consequence of the greenhouse effect, collector air gets warmer with time. Momentum of air increases with the improvement of thermal energy content of the air medium, and it is accelerated owing to the remarkable pressure difference provided by the massive chimney. Although solar energy is a driving force for solar chimneys, the system is capable of producing energy even in night time because of the aforesaid pressure difference between the inlet and outlet sections of the chimney [5]. The idea of solar chimney dates back to 1903, however, first successful applications in the world appear in 1980s. solar chimney power plants (SCPPs) are highly in the centre of interest especially over the last three decades owing to their characteristic ability in large-scale harnessing of solar energy. SCPPs are giant structures, however, it is usually possible to express that a typical system consists of three main parts, which are chimney, collector and turbine [6]. Collector is usually constructed by transparent materials like polythene or clear glass. It is fixed horizontally or at a specific slope via steel frames, and mounted at a certain height from the ground to be able to welcome air from outside to inside through air vents [7]. The level of greenhouse effect beneath the collector is directly associated with the collector radius, transmissivity coefficient of the collector material and the thermophysical properties of the ground. Materials with high specific heat capacity are usually considered on the ground of SCPPs. Stored energy within the ground material during the daytime contributes to maintain the buoyant forces even after the sunset. Chimney as the core of the plant is mounted in the middle of collector, and provides a notable pressure difference between chimney inlet and outlet. Geometric parameters such as chimney height and chimney diameter play a key role in the said pressure difference. Maximum air velocities are usually observed at a certain height above the chimney inlet, and a turbine is placed at that position to convert kinetic energy of air to electrical energy. Current turbines utilised in SCPPs can succeed this energy conversion by an efficiency over 80% as reported in literature [8]. The first pilot application of SCPPs appears in 1982 in Manzanares, Spain. The pilot plant has a chimney height of 194.6 m, chimney diameter of 10.16 m, collector diameter of 244 m and collector height of 1.85 m. A fixed horizontal collector design is preferred for the system covering 40,000 m2 membrane and 6000 m2 clear glass. In the early 1980s, Haaf et al. [9] conduct several experimental and numerical research on the pilot plant for an overall performance evaluation of the entire system. Their results indicate that there is a temperature rise of 20 \u00b0C in the collector air from inlet to outlet. For the solar intensity of 1000 W/m2, maximum velocity of air is reported to be about 15 m/s around the turbine inlet. The power output of the pilot plant corresponding to this velocity is given to be 55 kW. It is also underlined that chimney height is a significant geometric parameter on the performance figures of a SCPP. Chimney height is widely studied in other works as well over the last three decades through theoretical and numerical analyses. For instance, Mullett [10] carries out a research for overall performance assessment of SCPPs with different chimney heights. It is found that the efficiency of a plant with a chimney height of 1000 m is about 1%, which is also verified in similar works. The results also reveal that the estimated power output of a typical plant with a chimney height of 200 m and chimney diameter of 250 m is 100 kW whereas it is 10000 kW with a chimney height and diameter of 400 and 1780 m, respectively. Ngala et al. [11] numerically investigate the dependency of power output on chimney height. It is achieved from their results that there is a linear relationship between the chimney height and the power output in SCPPs. Choi et al. [12] develop a mathematical model to evaluate how the geometric parameters and heat storage medium on the ground affect the power output of a typical SCPP. The results indicate that the power output is enhanced by the rise in chimney height and diameter. On the other hand, considering heat storage medium on the ground is found to reduce the power output in the daytime, whereas it notably contributes to energy generation after sunset. Zhou et al. [13] develop a numerical model for determining the optimum chimney height for the pilot plant in Manzanares. They report that the power output rises with the chimney height until a specific value of 615 m. For greater chimney heights, power output is observed to decrease for the existing geometric parameters of the plant. They also address that for optimum operational conditions, chimney height needs to be increased in proportion to the collector diameter. Another model is developed by Ming et al. [14] for performance investigation of SCPPs. The findings of the 3D model show that there is a linear relationship between the chimney height and power output. System efficiency is also found improving with the rise in chimney height. For a solar intensity of 1000 W/m2, enhancing chimney height from 200 to 500 m yields to a threefold improvement in the power output. Li et al. [15] theoretically investigate the performance of Manzanares pilot plant. Through the MATLAB code developed, the impacts of collector diameter and chimney height on main performance figures of the plant are analysed. On the contrary to the findings of Zhou et al. [13], they report that there is no optimum value for the chimney height in SCPPs. When chimney height is increased to 2000 m, power output is predicted to enhance about sevenfold and exceeds 400 kW according to their results. Larbi et al. [16] propose a mathematical model for a typical plant with a chimney height of 250 m and a collector diameter of 600 m. For the said geometric parameters, power output of the plant is predicted to be 3.42 MW. However, it reaches 7 MW when the chimney height is enhanced to 500 m. They also report that power output reduces with the increase in ambient temperature. Shahi et al. [17] develop a 2D model for the Manzanares pilot plant, and examine the influence of chimney height on power output. For the existing geometric parameters, power output is found to be 48 kW for the solar radiation of 1000 W/m2 whereas it is reported to be 50 kW in the experimental studies. Then, numerical research is repeated for the chimney heights of 400, 600, 800 and 1000 m. It is achieved through the findings that the power output exceeds 300 kW for the chimney height of 1000 m. Dhahri et al. [18] evaluate the performance figures of SCPPs with respect to changes in environmental and geometric parameters. When chimney height is risen from 200 to 300 m, mass flow rate of the system is found to improve by about 20%. On the other hand, this change reduces the temperature rise of air along the collector from 22 to 16 \u00b0C. Toghraie et al. [19] conduct a 3D CFD research for a SCPP with a chimney height of 100 m, a chimney diameter of 4 m, a collector diameter of 200 m and a collector height of 2 m. Standard k-\u03b5 turbulence model is considered in the numerical methodology. For the solar intensity of 800 W/m2, power output is determined to enhance more than 100% when the chimney height is increased twofold. They also report that power output is expected to decrease after a certain value of chimney height. It is concluded from the literature survey that SCPPs are investigated by many researchers through theoretical and numerical models, and most of the works merely focus on main performance figures such as power output. It is addressed in different studies that chimney height is a significant geometric parameter in SCPPs, however there are still contradictions between the results of previous researchers concerning with the influence of chimney height on power output. In order to elucidate the abovementioned contradictions and inconsistencies, an elaborative CFD research is presented within the scope of this research. A unique 3D axisymmetric CFD model is developed with a DO oriented solar ray tracing radiation model. Following the accuracy justification of the numerical results through the performance reports of Manzanares pilot plant, impact of chimney height is comprehensively assessed. Temperature, velocity and pressure distributions as well as mass flow rates and power output values within the plant are illustrated as a function of chimney height for a reliable and scientific methodology. Theoretical background The present study aims at proposing a reliable and accurate simulation model for SCPPs by taking geometric and material characteristics of Manzanares pilot plant into consideration. Specifically, chimney height is investigated in the numerical model as an independent variable for its potential influence on velocity, temperature and pressure distributions as well as power output. Accuracy justification is done for maximum air velocities for various solar intensity levels in the range of 100\u20131000 W/m2. Continuity, momentum, energy and turbulence model equations are solved simultaneously to achieve the aforesaid performance parameters. Following assumptions are considered in the present work: Numerical analyses are conducted for the steady-state conditions. Changes in climatic conditions are assumed to be negligible. Boussinesq approximation is preferred to calculate the change of air density. Heat losses across the chimney walls can be ignored. There is a uniform and constant solar radiation during each process. The radiative transfer equation is represented by the discrete ordinate (DO) non-grey radiation model. Following continuity, momentum and energy equations are solved coupled in the numerical analyses: \u25aa Continuity equation: (1) \u2202 \u03c1 \u2202 t + \u2202 ( \u03c1 u ) \u2202 x + \u2202 ( \u03c1 v ) \u2202 y + \u2202 ( \u2202 w ) \u2202 z = 0 \u25aa Momentum equation: (2) \u2202 ( \u03c1 u ) \u2202 t + \u2202 ( \u03c1 u u ) \u2202 x + \u2202 ( \u03c1 u v ) \u2202 y + \u2202 ( \u03c1 u w ) \u2202 z = - \u2202 p \u2202 x + \u03bc \u2202 2 u \u2202 x 2 + \u2202 2 u \u2202 y 2 + \u2202 2 u \u2202 z 2 (3) \u2202 ( \u03c1 v ) \u2202 t + \u2202 ( \u03c1 v u ) \u2202 x + \u2202 ( \u03c1 v v ) \u2202 y + \u2202 ( \u03c1 v w ) \u2202 z = - \u2202 p \u2202 y + \u03bc \u2202 2 v \u2202 x 2 + \u2202 2 v \u2202 y 2 + \u2202 2 v \u2202 z 2 (4) \u2202 ( \u03c1 w ) \u2202 t + \u2202 ( \u03c1 w u ) \u2202 x + \u2202 ( \u03c1 w v ) \u2202 y + \u2202 ( \u03c1 w w ) \u2202 z = - \u2202 p \u2202 z + \u03bc \u2202 2 w \u2202 x 2 + \u2202 2 w \u2202 y 2 + \u2202 2 w \u2202 z 2 + \u03c1 g \u03b2 ( T - T a ) \u25aa Energy equation: (5) \u2202 ( \u03c1 c T ) \u2202 t + \u2202 ( p c u T ) \u2202 x + \u2202 ( p c v T ) \u2202 y + \u2202 ( p c w T ) \u2202 z = \u03bb \u2202 2 T \u2202 x 2 + \u2202 2 T \u2202 y 2 + \u2202 2 T \u2202 z 2 It is well-documented in literature that the air flow in SCPPs belongs to turbulent flow, and a wide range of turbulence models is utilised by researchers in the numerical modelling works of these systems. When the whole turbulence models are briefly evaluated, it can be easily asserted that RNG k-\u03b5 and standard k-\u03b5 turbulence models are much more in the centre of interest as a consequence of their efficacy and simplicity. Further evaluations reveal that RNG k-\u03b5 turbulence model leads in terms of a thorough accordance and coherence owing to the turbulent viscosity term that the model has. \u25aa RNG k-\u03b5 turbulence model equation: (6) \u2202 \u2202 t \u03c1 k + \u2202 \u2202 x i \u03c1 k u i = \u2202 \u2202 x j \u03b1 k \u03bc eff \u2202 k \u2202 x j + G k + G b + \u03c1 \u03b5 - Y M + S k (7) \u2202 \u2202 t \u03c1 \u03b5 + \u2202 \u2202 x i \u03c1 \u03b5 u i = \u2202 \u2202 x j \u03b1 \u03b5 \u03bc eff \u2202 \u03b5 \u2202 x j + C 1 \u03b5 \u03b5 k G k + C 3 \u03b5 G b - C 2 \u03b5 \u03c1 \u03b5 2 k - R e + S \u03b5 The presence of mean velocity gradient yields to the turbulent kinetic energy production. This is represented in equations (6) and (7) with G k , and the said term is expressed as follows: (8) G k = - \u03c1 u i u j \u2202 u i \u2202 u j On the other hand, buoyant forces also contribute to turbulent kinetic energy production, which is given with the term G b in the same equations. G b can be calculated by the following equation: (9) G b = \u03b2 g i \u03bc t Pr t \u2202 t \u2202 x i In the turbulence model equation, Y M refers to how the fluctuating dilatation in compressible turbulence affects the overall dissipation rate. Y M can be expressed by the following equation: (10) Y M = 2 \u03c1 \u03b5 M t 2 where M t is the Mach number in turbulent flow. M t can be calculated by (11) M t = k a 2 The inverse effective Prandtl numbers for \u03b5 and k are represented by \u03b1 \u03b5 and \u03b1 k , respectively. The additional term which differs RNG k-\u03b5 turbulence model from the standard model is given below: (12) R \u03b5 = C \u03bc \u03c1 \u03b7 3 ( 1 - \u03b7 / \u03b7 0 ) 1 + \u03b2 \u03b7 3 \u03b5 2 k In the aforesaid equation, \u03b7 0 = 4.38, \u03b2 =0.012 and \u03b7 = S k / \u03b5 [20]. Instant streamline and strain curvatures can be adapted in the RNG k-\u03b5 turbulence model. Boussinesq model helps to calculate the change in air density in the numerical calculations. By considering the buoyancy parameter in the momentum equation, air density is defined in the model as follows: (13) \u03c1 - \u03c1 a g \u2248 - \u03c1 a \u03b2 T - T a In the said equation, \u03c1 a is the air density at ambient temperature of T a , and \u03b2 refers to thermal expansion coefficient. When the literature on SCPPs is evaluated, it is easy to say that there are various methods to determine the power output of the system. In the meantime, main effective parameters are listed as turbine pressure drop, chimney efficiency, turbine efficiency and collector efficiency in most cases. Different figures are utilised in literature for the turbine efficiency ( \u03b7 t ). However, \u03b7 t is taken to be 0.8 in the present work [21]. Collector efficiency ( \u03b7 coll ) is another significant term of the numerical model. Its value is highly dependent on the incoming solar radiation, and calculated as follows: (14) \u03b7 coll = Q \u0307 A coll G In the said equation, Q \u0307 refers to available thermal power of the system, and given by (15) Q \u0307 = m \u0307 c p T 1 - T 2 = m \u0307 c p \u0394 T where temperature increase through the collector is expressed with \u0394 T . For the determination of turbine pressure drop, there are also different expression in literature. Turbine pressure drop ( \u0394 P t ) is associated with the air velocity at the turbine inlet through a linear regression as given below: (16) \u0394 P t = 18 , 87 v - 57 , 59 Power output in a SCPP can be calculated through the following equation: (17) P tot = m \u0307 g H c \u0394 T T a where T a is the ambient temperature, \u0394 T is the temperature difference between inlet and outlet sections of the collector, H c is the chimney height, g is the gravitational acceleration and m \u0307 is the mass flow rate of air. By considering Q v is the volumetric flow rate, power output can also be obtained by (18) P tot = \u03b7 t \u0394 P t Q v CFD analyses The numerical methodology adopted in the present research is based on a unique 3D axisymmetric CFD model developed for the SCPP in Manzanares, Spain. Exact material properties and geometric parameters of the pilot plant listed in Table 1 are utilised in the CFD model for a realistic, reliable and scientific approach. It would be useful to illustrate the outline of the solar chimney concept analysed in the CFD research with the system components and boundary conditions as depicted in Fig. 1 . Physical properties of the ground, chimney and collector glass are of vital importance for the efficacy of the numerical approach, and thus the aforesaid data is obtained from the in-situ measurements as shown in Table 2 . Besides, there are some constructional and operational parameters, climatic data and thermophysical properties shown in Table 3 , which are utilised in the CFD analyses. As a consequence of intensive cell counts, iterations take a significant period of time ranging from 24 to 36 h for each case. Since the case is axisymmetric, one-quarter part of the pilot plant is modelled in the analyses via two plane symmetries (YZ and XZ planes) to expedite the convergence. When the whole geometry is considered, it can be asserted that curvatures outweigh the smooth surfaces, hence triangular mesh type is preferred in the CFD analyses as illustrated in Fig. 2 . ANSYS FLUENT is utilised in the CFD analyses as one of the most reliable and well-documented commercial software in market. Finite volume approach, which is used by ANSYS FLUENT is an ideal method for solving the governing equations in the present work. In order to solve the momentum equation in the numerical research, RNG k-\u03b5 turbulence model is considered. To be able to determine the interaction between the velocity and pressure figures of air, SIMPLE algorithm is used. PRESTO technique is adopted for the pressure interpolation. Governing equations are discretised by second order upwind method. DO non-grey radiation approach with solar ray tracing method is preferred for radiation equation. Exact latitude and longitude data of Manzanares, Spain is utilised in the radiation model for accurate calculation of solar beam direction. Boussinesq approximation is adopted to determine the variation of air density with temperature. An ideal value of 10-6 is selected for the convergence criterion in the iterations. Parametric research is conducted once the mesh-independent solutions are obtained. Results and discussion Mesh-independent solution is comprehensively proposed prior to the demonstration of the results of parametric research. In this respect, over the three main performance parameters, which are mass flow rate of air ( m \u0307 ) at the turbine inlet, maximum air temperature ( T m ) and maximum air velocity ( V m ), dependency on cell counts is determined as shown in Table 4 . For the cell count of 386041, % change in m \u0307 and V m is observed to be 0.24 and 1.75, respectively. As the aforesaid figures are satisfactory enough in comparison with the similar works in literature, the whole CFD is research is carried out over this cell count. Following the satisfaction of mesh-independent solution, accuracy verification of the CFD model is done through the V m values in the pilot plant acquired for various solar intensities in the range of 100\u20131000 W/m2. It can be easily understood from the preliminary findings of the CFD model shown in Fig. 3 that present work is in very good accordance with the experimental results [22], and provides the best fitted tendency of V m with respect to changes in environmental conditions. When pioneer numerical works in the scope [14] are analysed in detail, it is achieved that notable deviations occur especially for high solar intensity levels. This can be ascribed to the considerable role of turbulence and radiation models in the overall efficacy after a certain value of solar radiation. On the contrary to the said works, present work provides an excellent agreement with the measurements owing to RNG k-\u03b5 turbulence model and DO non-grey radiation model assisted by solar ray tracing approach. V m is found to be 14.24 m/s for the solar radiation level of 1000 W/m2, while it is given to be 15 m/s in the experimental reports. As previously mentioned, Manzanares pilot plant has a chimney height ( H ) of 194.6 m. By taking all the other geometric parameters constant, H is considered to be as an independent variable within the scope of this research, and main performance figures are obtained for five different values of H in the range of 100\u2013500 m. V m is the first parameter in this respect, and Fig. 4 demonstrates its variation with H . It is clear from the data that V m exponentially rises with H . This can be easily attributed to the improved buoyant forces with the increase in chimney height as a consequence of enhanced pressure difference between inlet and outlet sections of chimney. A regression analysis is performed to the numerical data, and the following equation is developed for the first time in literature for the relationship between V m and H : (19) V m = 8.178 1 - e - 0.03551 H + 14.25 1 - e - 0.00268 H The proposed regression model indicates that there is an expected optimum figure for chimney height since V m has a tendency of exponential rise to a maximum data. However, it is difficult to make a generalisation regarding the exact optimum value of H since a comprehensive life-cycle cost analysis is required for such an attempt covering the chimney cost. Detailed static contours of air velocities in the pilot plant for the chimney height of 100 and 500 m are illustrated in Fig. 5 . It is unequivocal from the findings that buoyant effects remarkably contribute to the momentum which yields to improvements in V m values around the turbine inlet. Pressure distributions through the power plant especially about the turbine inlet are of vital importance for performance assessment of SCPPs. In this respect, dynamic pressure differences ( \u0394 P dyn ) at 9 m above the chimney inlet in which the turbine is fixed are determined as depicted in Fig. 6 . It is clear from the findings that \u0394 P dyn values are notably enhanced by the rise in H . Maximum \u0394 P dyn for H = 100 m is found to be \u221267.22 Pa whereas it is \u2212147.24 and \u2212202.82 Pa for H = 300 and 500 m, respectively as illustrated in Fig. 7 . Following regression model is obtained through the parametric research: (20) \u0394 P dyn = - 328.4 1 - e - 0.001632 H - 19.33 1 - e - 0.02488 Exponential rise of momentum effects with the chimney height can also be verified through the aforesaid data. Temperature rise across the collector of the pilot plant is also investigated in the present work as shown in Fig. 8 . Chimney height is a significant parameter in terms of momentum effects as previously mentioned. However, it is observed from the temperature contours that thermal energy content of air beneath the collector is remarkably deteriorated by the increase in chimney height. This can be attributed to the shorter period of time of air while it is flowing through the collector area when the buoyant forces are improved with H . In the CFD analyses, air is assumed to enter the collector with a temperature of 293.15 K. At the outlet of the collector, air is found to reach a maximum temperature of 304.4 K when H = 100 m. On the contrary, it can only rise up to 301.2 K when the chimney height is 500 m. From this point of view, it can be concluded that chimney height and collector diameter are the performance parameters which interact each other, and for an optimum performance, they are required to be enlarged by an appropriate ratio between the said parameters. In SCPPs there is a connection path between the outlet of collector and the inlet of chimney. In this area, some part of the kinetic energy of air transforms into thermal energy due to intensive collisions of air molecules, and by doing so, additional increase in air temperature is observed as shown in Fig. 9 . This is expressed as the overall temperature rise in the collector, and should not be confused with maximum temperature increase. Following equation is developed through the regression model between average \u0394 T and H : (21) \u0394 T = 12.63 + 11.94 e - 0.005963 H Mass flow rate ( m \u0307 ) is an important parameter which needs to be analysed in terms of its potential change with chimney height. Fig. 10 illustrates that m \u0307 exponentially increases with H . For H = 100 m, m \u0307 is found to be 886.76 kg/s whereas it is 1496.35 kg/s for the chimney height of 500 m. This result is also an expected output of improved buoyant forces in the chimney with the enhanced momentum effects. A similar tendency is already achieved for the V m values as previously discussed. Regression model proposes the following correlation between m \u0307 and H : (22) m \u0307 = 686.8 1 - e - 0.02597 H - 1142 1 - e - 0.002487 Efficiency (\u03b7) of SCPPs is notably poor because of the huge collector area. In the efficiency expression, the incoming solar power is written to the denominator which yields to very low figures. In literature, overall efficiencies of SCPPs vary in the range of 0.2\u20131% depending on geometric parameters [19]. An efficiency analysis is also carried out within the scope of this research to examine the influence of chimney height. Fig. 11 indicates that there is a linear relationship between \u03b7 and H . This is also justified through the regression analysis as follows: (23) \u03b7 = 0.003458 + 0.001307 H Power output ( P ) of the pilot plant is also analysed as a function of chimney height as depicted in Fig. 12 . It is achieved that P rises linearly with H . For a chimney height of 200 m, the system is found to generate 55 kW electrical power while it is improved to 134 kW when H is increased to 500 m. The relationship between the power output and chimney height can be expressed by the following equation: (24) P = 712.4 + 270.8 H Conclusions Chimney height is comprehensively analysed in terms of its potential impacts on main performance parameters. 3D axisymmetric CFD model is developed for the geometric parameters and material characteristics of Manzanares pilot plant. Following the accuracy justification of the CFD results through previous works in the scope, parametric research is conducted for five different chimney heights in the range of 100\u2013500 m. Temperature, velocity and pressure contours are achieved for each case. Mass flow rate of air, average temperature rise in collector, average dynamic pressure difference at the turbine position, system efficiency and power output are numerically determined. Following bullet points can be concluded from the research: \u25aa CFD model shows a very good agreement with the previous measurements in the pilot plant for certain radiation conditions. V m is reported to be about 15 m/s in the experimental analyses for a solar intensity of 1000 W/m2, whereas it is found 14.24 m/s in the CFD research. \u25aa V m thus m \u0307 shows an exponential growth with the chimney height. \u25aa Pressure distributions within the plant are of vital importance in terms of accurate assessment of buoyant forces and momentum effects. Maximum \u0394 P dyn for a chimney height of 100 m is found to be \u221267.22 Pa while it is \u2212147.24 and \u2212202.82 Pa for H = 300 and 500 m, respectively. \u25aa Temperature rise in collector is negatively affected by the rise in chimney height. Air reaches a maximum temperature of 304.4 K when H = 100 m. On the other hand, it can only rise up to 301.2 K when the chimney height is 500 m. \u25aa m \u0307 can be enhanced from 886.76 to 1496.35 kg/s when H is increased from 100 to 500 m. \u25aa Efficiency of the plant shows a linearly increasing tendency with chimney height. \u03b7 is calculated to be 0.15% for H = 100 m while it is improved to 0.67% when H = 500 m. \u25aa A linear relationship between power output of the plant and chimney height is observed. For H = 200 and 500 m, the system is capable of providing 55 and 134 kW electrical power, respectively.
